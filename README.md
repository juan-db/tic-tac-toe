# tic-tac-toe
Simple command-line tic tac toe game.

I created this little program to experiment with the [Monte Carlo tree search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search).

# Usage

`java -jar tictactoe.jar` will create a tic tac toe instance with board width and height set to 3. Alternatively you can specify the board dimensions and how many pieces you need in a line to win using ```java -jar tictactoe.jar [width height consec]```.

Running `java -jar help` will print out the usage information as well.
